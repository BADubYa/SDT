**Description:**

Sample Data Tracking is a utility I built for myself as a side project to help me navigate a robust data warehouse. Actual files needed to run this program are not included so as not to disclose actual data files.  The source code should aid as a guide on how you can import any relationally complex data set(s) to this program (from excel) and "slice and dice" it in a way to aid your queries.

Please refer to the Power Point document for a more in depth description of what SDT entails. I can be contacted with further questions on this program.
