**Description:**

Sample Data Tracking is a work "related" project. SDT  is a utility I built for myself as a side project to a work assignment. My source code was only used by me. Consequently, while I can provide my source code, I cannot release the supporting data and documents needed to successfully run an executable file, as this data is considered classified.

Please refer to the Power Point document for a more in depth description of what SDT entails.

In short, SDT is a good example of how programming can organize data in a format that makes it much more accessible and digestible to an end user. It certaintly helped me in my first ever, "on the job" programming assignment.
